# fltk

This is an introductory C++ / FLTK tutorial based on Bjarne Stroustrup's graphics library.

In this tutorial we see an introduction on how to make a graphical user interface (GUI) using C++ and the Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK or "Fulltick") library.

Our purpose in this tutorial is to simulate the collisions of circular objects moving at constant speed.
