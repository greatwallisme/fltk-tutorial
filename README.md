In this tutorial we see an introduction on how to make a graphical user interface (GUI) using C++ and the Fast Light Toolkit library.

Our purpose in this tutorial is to simulate the collisions of circular objects moving at constant speed.

This tutorial is based on:
(1) The book "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup, have a look at his website: http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/
(2) The programming manual website of fltk: http://fltk.org/doc-1.3/

However, I simplified a lot the code of Bjarne Stroustrup's graphics library, because I wanted to focus only on the basics.
